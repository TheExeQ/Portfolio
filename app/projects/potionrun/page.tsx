                Potion Run was the first game project that i developed during my time at The Game Assembly, it is a runner game in which a gnome character is tasked with delivering a potion to a village before it becomes corrupted by an evil monster. <br /><br />
                The game involves avoiding obstacles along the way in order to preserve as much of the potion as possible before arriving at the destination.
                As a runner game, the focus is on keeping the gnome character moving forward while navigating the obstacles that appear in his path.
